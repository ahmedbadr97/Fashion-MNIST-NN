![dataset-cover.png](dataset-cover.png)
- Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes
- dataset exists in [dataset directory](dataset)
  - two CSV files one for training and one for testing.
  - each file has rows of the images where col-1 represent the label of the image and the remaining 784 cols are the image pixels flattened
